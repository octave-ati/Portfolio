# :floppy_disk: SQL

Current level: Advanced

Databases used: MySQL, PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Apache. 

**Disclaimer :** Most of my experience in SQL was during my work as a Data Analyst for the French Navy. For obvious security reasons, I am not able to disclose the code for these projects.


| Project Name | Description | SQL Level |
|---|---|---|
| [Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis](https://github.com/Faskill/Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Cyclistic-Data-Analysis-Bike-Share/README.md) | This is my version of the capstone project for Google's Data Analytics Course, where I use open source data to provide insights about a bike sharing company. SQL was used to extract from a 2GB dataset the most relevant data for further analysis with R. | Intermediate |  
| [Improving a Media Strategy](https://github.com/Faskill/Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Improving%20a%20Media%20Strategy/README.md) | This project was the first project of my Bachelor's Degree, it showcases my ability to write beginner level SQL queries, its goal is to increase the audience of a Media Company. | Beginner |
